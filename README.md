## Features

- 3d view: the more vertical an arrow is, the more it is displaced in the z-direction. To see this, rotate the camera by holding shift while dragging the mouse, or or using two fingers on a touch screen (to move the display without rotating, use normal click and drag, or one finger on touch screen; to zoom in/out use pinch on a track pad or touch screen)
